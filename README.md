## Next Steps  

1. **Due Date Reminders**  
   Implement automated email or in-app notifications to remind users of upcoming or overdue return dates.

2. **Book Reviews and Ratings**  
   Allow users to rate the books they've borrowed, helping others discover quality content.

3. **Search and Filter Options**  
   Enhance the book browsing experience with advanced search and filtering by title, author, genre, or availability.

4. **Book Reservation System**  
   Enable users to reserve currently unavailable books and get notified when they become available.

5. **Support Multiple Copies of the Same Book**  
    Refactor the system to handle books with multiple copies instead of assuming only one copy per title. This includes tracking the number of available copies, adjusting inventory during checkout and return, and updating the UI to reflect real-time availability.
